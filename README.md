# encryptfun
A collection of simple encryption methods made for fun, mostly to pass time and test my skills. This was done without any resources, so I am curious how it compares to professionals who have attempted the same thing.

**Keep in mind, I DO NOT know C++ well, code is probably awful and could be done better**

__Included encrypt and decrypt methods so far__:
- Caesar Cipher
